# rellog create release note GitHub Action

`tooppoo/rellog/actions/create-release-note` creates a GitHub Release using a rellog-generated release note as the release body.
It reads `.rellog/release-notes/<release-id>.md`, strips the leading version header line (the automatically generated `## <release-id>` line, since GitHub uses the tag/release name as the title already), and passes the remainder to [`softprops/action-gh-release`](https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release) as `body_path`.
It optionally forwards a `files` input to `softprops/action-gh-release` to attach release assets.

The action is a release-creation wrapper only. It does not run `rellog ready`, `rellog prepare`, or `rellog replace`.
It always reads the release note from the repository root (`github.workspace`); there is no working-directory option.

## Usage

Check out the caller repository before running the action so the runner has the repository's `.rellog/release-notes/` directory at the repository root.
The calling job must grant `contents: write` permission (or supply an equivalent PAT via `GITHUB_TOKEN`), because `softprops/action-gh-release` needs it to create the release.

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7

      - uses: tooppoo/rellog/actions/create-release-note@v0.0.4
        with:
          release-id: v1.2.0
          files: |
            dist/*.tar.gz
            dist/checksums.txt
```

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `release-id` | yes | | Release id to publish, in `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` form (with optional pre-release/build metadata). Used as the release tag and to locate `.rellog/release-notes/<release-id>.md`. |
| `files` | no | | Newline-delimited list of path globs for asset files to attach to the release. Forwarded as-is to `softprops/action-gh-release`'s `files` input. |

## Failure behavior

The action fails before creating a release when:

- `.rellog/release-notes/<release-id>.md` does not exist at the repository root.

After the release note is prepared, the action delegates to `softprops/action-gh-release`. If that step fails, for example because the caller lacks `contents: write` permission or a `files` glob matches nothing unexpected, the action fails with that step's output.
